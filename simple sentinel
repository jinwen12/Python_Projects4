#Sometimes a programmer does not know how many times data is to be entered.

#Create a program that adds an unknown amount of positive numbers that will be entered by the user.

#The program stops adding numbers when the user enters a zero or a negative number.

#Then the program prints the total.

#Input Format

#an unknown amount of positive numbers followed by one zero or negative number

#Constraints

#all input will be whole numbers

#Output Format

#one whole number that is the sum of all positive inputs




number=int(input("number?"))
x=1
answer=0
while x>0:
      if number>0:
         answer=answer+number
         number=int(input("again"))
         x+=1
      else:
            x=0
print(answer)
